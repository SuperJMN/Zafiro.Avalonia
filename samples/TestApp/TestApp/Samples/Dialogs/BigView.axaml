            In a village of La Mancha, whose name I have no desire to recall, there lived not long ago a gentleman of the kind who keeps a lance in the rack, an ancient shield, a lean nag, and a fast greyhound. A stew with more beef than mutton, hash on most nights, lentils on Fridays, eggs and bacon on Saturdays, and the occasional pigeon on Sundays consumed three quarters of his income. The remainder went on a broadcloth coat, velvet breeches for feast days, and slippers of the same, while on weekdays he wore his finest homespun.

            He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece not yet twenty, and a lad for the field and market who could saddle the nag or prune a vine. The age of this gentleman bordered on fifty years. He was of a sturdy constitution, spare of flesh, gaunt of face, a very early riser, and a great lover of hunting. People say his surname was Quijada, or Quesada, though accounts differ on this point, and this story tells of how his imagination carried him away.
